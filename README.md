# Flashcard ðŸ“š
This is not intended as an Anki replacement. This should only be used as a tool to compliment your learning with Anki.

The purpose of this tool is to allow you to freely review decks without requiring you to mess with Anki's daily review limitations.
### Installation
- Download [**flashcard.rar**](https://github.com/rossw01/Flashcard/releases/download/Beta/flashcard.rar) and extract. 
- Run flashcard.exe
### Usage
- Import your Anki deck using the '**Import Deck**' button (**Only Anki's proprietary .apkg files will work**), this shouldn't take more than 5-10 seconds unless you have an absurdly large Anki deck (i.e. 5000+ cards in the file, stored on a HDD).
- Select your desired subdeck in the sidebar.
- Select Begin practice.
### Keybinds
#### During a study session, you have some keybinds you can use to make things easier. They are the same as Anki's defaults:
- **1, 2, 3, 4** correspond to 'Again', 'Hard', 'Okay', 'Known' buttons respectively.
- **Space** Will reveal the answer of the current card.

If you find anything wrong with this release, please [**create an issue**](https://github.com/rossw01/Flashcard/issues) and provide whatever details you can. ðŸ˜Ž
